# Gesso Component Library

This repository is a library containing Gesso components for use with the `gesso` utility.

The repository contains a subfolder for each component. The component description itself is stored in a YAML file in each subdirectory with the same name of the subfolder with the semantic version appended to the name. Additionally, in each component subfolder are the README.md and LICENSE files corresponding to the component in the subfolder.
